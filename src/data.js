      "The Naltar Valley is located 34 km from the town of Gilgit. Its nature is very rich and in 1975 a protected area was created. The reserve is covered with forests, mixed mountain forests, deciduous and coniferous. Coniferous species present include Picea and Juniperus. Naltar Valley is a beautiful place to visit in any season, but the winter months offer some of the most stunning scenery. The snow-capped mountains and frozen lakes are a photographer’s dream, and the crisp, cold air is invigorating.",
